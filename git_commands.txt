Basic commands for using git through command line.

## Configure settings
git config --global user.name "Your Name" // Does not have to match your Github username. Just your name is fine.
git config --global user.email abc@example.com // Must match Github email.

## One time setup
First, 'cd' to local folder on computer that you will use for keeping your own copy of the repository.
Then, use command 'git init' to initilize git.
Clone the existing repo by running 'git clone https://github.com/laic5/presidential-2016-polls.git'

Now, edit files or folders as you wish. This will be reflected locally. To push:

## Repeated commands
git add -A // This will add all changed files to staging.
git commit -m "Type a note here about the update" // Commit the changes.
// Double check if repo has changed since you last pulled. If no changes, just run the push command.
git push -f https://github.com/laic5/presidential-2016-polls.git master
