Swing states for the 2016 Election

* Florida - always a swing state...

* Michigan - not always that important of a swing state but for 2016, it was important as it gave Trump the needed votes to across 270
electoral votes.

* Pennsylvania - recount in progress. again, Clinton really needed all votes and this one went to Trump.

* New Hampshire - tight polls leading up, Clinton won by small margin.

* Nevada - used to be Republican state but voted for Obama in 08 and 12, so it was important to watch and as Clinton really needed any
vote she could get.

* Wisconsin - polls were tight leading up to Election night but became even more important as the night went on when the candidates needed
every single vote. in fact, recount is in progress.

* Ohio - this was important in the beginning of Election night as early indication to see if Trump even had a chance, but as
the night went on, it was clear Ohio was Trump's, so it kind of became less important to watch.
